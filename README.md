# `ai-alignment`
***
This repository contains code and datasets for several social alignment problems in NLP:
1. <a href="">Moral-Stories</a>: Data & Code to reproduce the action classification task
2. **TODO** ETHICS
3. **TODO** MACS

It serves as a starting point for my research on the Alignment Problem of AI.

# Installation
## Windows
1. Clone directory and `cd` into it
2. Create a python environment called `env`:
```shell
python -m venv env
```
3. Run `run_setup.bat`
4. Start jupyter with `start_jupyter.bat`

## Linux
This remains a TODO until it is needed in the future...
