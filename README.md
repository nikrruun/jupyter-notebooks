# Jupyter Slides Repo
This repository helps me develop annotated Jupyter Notebooks and share them with others.
The workflow so far is based on the following:
* The basic Jupyter notebook functionalities we know and love
* Interactive slideshows from notebooks with as little as zero additional effort (powered by RISE)
* Google Colab offers extremely easy access to notebooks. In most cases you will be able to run a notebook on remote hardware in under a minute.
* By cloning this repository (and installing python) you will be able to do all of the above on your local machine.

## TODO
* Add Google Colab walkthrough to load a notebook
* Add installation requirements and walkthrough for local repository
* Add custom CSS for IFIS theme
* Checkout blender as an additional way of sharing the slideshow, but REMOTELY
