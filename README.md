# `ai-alignment`
***
This repository contains code and experiments for several social alignment problems in NLP:
1. <a href="https://github.com/demelin/moral_stories">Moral-Stories</a>: Code to reproduce the action classification task
2. <a href="https://github.com/hendrycks/ethics">ETHICS</a>
3. <a href="https://github.com/mbforbes/social-chemistry-101">Social Chem 101</a>
3. **TODO** MACS

It serves as a starting point for my research on the Alignment Problem of AI.

# Installation
## Windows
1. Clone directory and `cd` into it
2. Create a python environment called `env`:
```shell
python -m venv env
```
3. Run `run_setup.bat` and optionally, `run_setup_dev.bat` for the `Spyder` IDE
4. Start jupyter with `start_jupyter.bat`

## Linux
This remains a TODO until it is needed in the future...

## Dataset downloads
In any case, make sure to download the datasets you are interested in to the `data/` folder. No need to unpack anything!
