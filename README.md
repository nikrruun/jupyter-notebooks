# jupyter-notebooks
This repository is the basic structure I use when starting a new python project based on jupyter notebooks.
It really isn't much, but it helps me to get things started.
Currently, it only installs `jupyter`, `rise` and some other default libraries.

# Installation
## Windows
1. Clone directory and `cd` into it
2. Create a python environment called `env`:
```shell
python -m venv env
```
3. Run `run_setup.bat`
4. Start jupyter with `start_jupyter.bat`

## Linux
This remains a TODO until it is needed in the future...
